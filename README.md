# LipReading

Lipreading decodes speech by watching how someoneâ€™s mouth moves. Advancements in deep lipreading usually have two steps: preprocessing and using deep neural net- works. While most focus on improving neural networks, we concentrated on refining preprocessing. In this project, we investigated the impact of introducing a preprocess- ing technique that highlights the segmentation around the lips on the accurancy of lipreading. Through the utilization of BlazeFace and BiseNet, we emphasized the lip segment within each video and the LipNet model was trained using this modified data. We evaluated five preprocessing methods using Miracl-VC1 for English and AI Hub Korean LipRead- ing data. Contrary to our expectations, lip region utiliza- tion resulted in poor outcomes. But, when the contour addi- tion and cropped lip methods were applied to Korean data, it performed a slightly better than baseline. However, this improvement was not significant. We discussed the reasons behind obtaining these experimental results, as well as the limitations and future work in our study.
